this whole month i did try to make a new iptv app with react+vite+tauri but rust is quite expensive, and what i did expected is not easy to achieve to my current level, even if try to learn some thoery and implement it on the road this could take forever to complete this project, but i was aimed to showcase this project in my resume/cv but some task is complex and very time consuming so i will keep working on this project until i done it what i intended (as min complete project) but al lest i should make a reasonable version to showcase, as this electron wrapped react+vite project works (at lest) so i will now make some improvements in this main project, previously this project was improved by vibe coded with claude (coder) and gpt (discussion), gemini (rare debugging case), but last 6 month i haven't vibe coded anything and I'm aiming to not so in future (except when vibe coding is a requirement).

Good Luck **
